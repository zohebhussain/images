Steps to create a react project:

1. create a folder where the project should be saved
2. In the terminal -  npm init react-app 'Name of the app' -> this will create the basic dependecies and template of the app.
3. in package.json if we want to enable CSS modules so that I can make sure that the CSS classes that we create CSS file can be scoped to a specific component in our application so that they are not applied globally when we would accidentally reuse the same CSS class.

npm run eject	-> Y

4. once ejected to implement CSS module you get access to the config in a config folder and there to webpack configuration files.
in CSS-loader-> getStyleLoaders  

              use: getStyleLoaders({
                importLoaders:1,
                sourceMap: shouldUseSourceMap,
                modules: {localIdentName: '[path][name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]'}
              }),
5. clean-up before starting the project
	src-> logo.svg - this can be removed
	remove it from App.js imports as well
	import logo from './logo.svg';
	
	in App.js file remove the entire header section, class name from div and import App.css and also App.css from src file too
	
6. 	for better font
	in index.css cahange the font family to sans-serif
	google --google fonts
	select open-sans
	select family selected
	change customize add bold700
	in Embed use the standard link and paste it above the title tag

Developing the components:

7. in src create components folder -> dumb or presentational components 
									  that do not manage state are only for representational purposes.
									  these could be class or functional components that are using hooks.
				 containers -> stateful components i.e. components created with class key word or functions that use state
8. create layout component in components folder
	code layout.js
